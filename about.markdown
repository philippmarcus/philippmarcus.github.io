Welcome to my personal blog!

My name is Philipp Marcus, originally from Munich, Bavaria and currently located in Beijing, China. I am currently working as an IT manager and in my spare time I enjoy working on hands-on IT projects. Most of these currently come from the Udacity programs "Data Science Nanodegree" and "Self-driving Car Nanodegree". In addition, I also post projects and contributions that I create myself, e.g. on the subject of AWS cloud computing or networking.

Besides computer science and work, I love to go kayaking and road cycling, train martial arts and to go hiking in beautiful nature with friends. I am also a passionate hobby cook who constantly tries to produce authentic Chinese dishes.

Before my current position, I worked as a research assitant with LMU Munich where I received the title of Dr. rer. nat. (PhD) in computer science. Before, during my studies I received a diploma with a major in computer science and a minor in physics, also from LMU Munich. The resulting research results are also linked on this page.
